It has a lot of cons as reviews on TrustRadius and G2 read like “Due to the way it (TargetX) is customized on Salesforce, it is very hard to use some 3rd party Salesforce AppExchange tools as they expect the data to be in a different model.”, “I have never seen a web app with worse or a more disjoint user interface. When they released their loudly-touted new SMS solution, it was worse than the old one and had almost no integration with the CRM. Separate window to bookmark and no data goes back and forth except basic contact details.”among many others. Institutions considering TargetX should ask questions if it provides easy interface, fits adapts around my teams easily, if it’s easy is it to implement and adopt and do they have a dedicated Customer Success team, to be able to choose the right solution to grow their enrollments.</p></div></div></div><div class="faq-block" itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"> <div id="heading3"> <h2 itemprop="name" class="faq-title mb-0"> <a type="button" href="javascript;void(0);" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ans3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ans3" class="collapsed"> <span class="mark-question mr-2">✅</span> Is TargetX part of Salesforce?</a> </h2> </div><div id="ans3" class="faq-content collapse" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqListing" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"> <div itemprop="text" class="faq-a"> <p>TargetX as a CRM platform is built on Saleforce which is why a lot of users refrain from using it as they have to take Salesforce licensing and pay for third-party solutions. As one of the verified user stated in the G2 Review, “Part of the problem is that the suite is built on top of Salesforce. It also requires several tertiary parties to fully function: Form Assembly for forms, Conga for mail merges, Informatica to write back to the SIS, and Demand Tools for data de-duplication. Each one has problems, and it's always complicated to find out where the problem is coming from and how to address it. Support is also an issue, but we have support through a reseller. “ It lacks features that are allow your enrollment teams to gather real time report in seconds. Users on popular software rating and reviewing sites have listed their “Customer service.” and “Exceptionally complicated” as major cons.</p></div></div></div></div>
